# two sides

Remembering the past,
Should'nt have done, though.
I’m chained to who I was,
And I live alone in the dark.

Give me a reason to smile
‘Til I saw you.
You were shining like the stars,
But then I remembered...

I live on the other side,
Nowhere to go and hide.
Stuck forever—not what I wished for.
We were like black and white,
Never meant to be together.

Overlooking the present
Gives me nonsensical predictions,
Like it was already the end,
And no roads to leave a trail.

I said, remember when we were
All smiling like it was nothing?
We were brighter than the sun,
But then I remembered...

I ran to the wild,
Found a way to the other side.
I left it all behind,
And now I paint the world
With colors.
We’ll go together.

Let’s go up,
Never going down.
Find a path,
And never lose track.
We’ll go together.
We’ll go together.
