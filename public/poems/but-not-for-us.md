# but not for us

If only things could come back,  
Then maybe life would be better or worse.  
But still, the chance is high  
That all will change.  

I can't remember being here.  
I never knew this would be  
What would happen to me.  
That's when I knew  
Life is never as you want it to.  

Fate is only a mysterious thing  
That plays with you, and it's mean.  
I never had a chance to fight back,  
But continuously drowning, intact.  

You can never escape this path you take,  
Where you're forced to stay, whatever it takes.  
Never had a chance to say yes or no,  
But it drags you where it wants to go.  

The pain you gain makes you alive.  
It gives you strength to fight back.  
You never knew you were fighting a void—  
No chance of winning, unlike never before.  

Trapped in a cage, trapped in a domino,  
Can't control oneself  
But is controlled by whom?  
Life is fair, that's what they say.  
Obviously, it is, but not for us.  

Can't stop what's happening,  
You're just there watching,  
Predicting the ending,  
Watching all the suffering.  

You're no more than a statue,  
Having none or less of a clue.  
You're like a leaf dragged by the wind—  
You'll never know where you'll be  
Until you already are.
