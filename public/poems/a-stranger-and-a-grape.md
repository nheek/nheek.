# a stranger and a grape

A grape once called a stranger a friend, so fragile and so brave  
Baffled as the friend was, a quiet miracle it was  
A season slipped away like the ghost town in his mind  
Storming through the days, his emotions as dormant as they go by  

The apple had already ripened the day this grape gave him light  
The stranger full of bliss, never thought of it, never missed  
For the stranger, the grape became his favourite  
And fate secretly led him to regret  

Leading his invisible strings to the grape, as innocent as he could get  
The stranger fell for it, the stranger so perplexed  
Every passing second he thought, his emotions might have erupted,  
Not of itself but of the grape  
The friend hid it as he can, the weaver of the galaxy had another plan  

And so the moon watches as the friend breaks it to the grape  
That he had hidden for so long, in the shadows of those who don't belong  
A marathon it became, as the stranger was running for two songs  
One of when the grape started rolling away,  
And one of his heart and his mind wandering through the air  

And so the dawn never came, not until the grape showed itself again  
The stranger is afraid that he'll never see the grape again  
He thinks the tower they've already built is much higher  
Than the adorement he had revealed  
Furious as he was, as he was left chasing illusions, he cannot decide  

But now the friend had talked to a sibyl  
He wants to see the grape as when the friend was a stranger  
Free of all the rot, only willing to start from scratch  
He calls for that, it reads between the lines  

The words are now out, the grape gets to read the tale  
The grape so precious to him, he needs no more than that  
The stranger can play along to the story,  
But asks the grape for a sorry  
Didn't mean to break anything, only wanted it for the story  

As for the plot, the second part was a lot  
Down the drain is not an option he could've taken  
As he tries to pretend he doesn't want the grape  
More and more, he wants to believe they both know better than that
