# belong

I’ll stay away,  
Gone to another place,  
Far away from home,  
Never seen places before.

Give me time,  
Hold the distance,  
I may not be there,  
But you’re always on my mind.

The guitar plays a tune,  
The wind rushes around,  
My heart beats like a drum,  
And the moon covers the night.

Still, my mind keeps thinking,  
Are you doing fine back home?  
Or do you need someone to carry you on?

Then he talks a wide small talk,  
We said the past is a long way back,  
How years pass and we didn’t see each other,  
We both knew nothing could change now.

And they’re down calling us for dinner,  
But we still talk and knew each other,  
Then we get down and eat our food,  
I see how you’ve all grown up a whole.

Though a decade passed that I didn’t meet you,  
I knew how we knew we could still do  
The things that were not meant for us,  
Then cried inside about the truth tonight.

You all were smiling like nothing’s wrong,  
And we all got full, and I felt I really belong.
