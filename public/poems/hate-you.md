# hate you

You could grow up with anyone,  
People who will say that you're the one.  
But when the time comes, you will realise  
Everyone you knew never needed you.

So when you grew up and had some freedom,  
You went your way and made your world fun.  
But you will always be the guy who keeps on  
Dreaming the whole world is on his side,  
'Cause precocious he was and alone for the nights.

You could live with anyone,  
People who will say that you are just fine.  
But when the time comes, you will realise  
You knew nothing of what you had felt.

So when you grew up and heard some truth,  
You lost your way and made sure everyone knew.  
You weren't hiding, but you weren't trying to show it—  
Everyone just knew exactly who you really were.

So when you met him, and her, and him, and him,  
The lights looked darker and brighter at night.  
But you gave everything for what you thought was right,  
For what you hoped was right.

But then they went on their ways to hate you.  
Then you felt every race out of your presence.  
It was hard keeping up when keeping up meant  
Giving all you had and getting nothing, getting everything,  
Too much of everything.

So when I became  
What I thought I wanted to be,  
The screams became my music,  
And the tears became my tea.

"I am the only one I can blame"  
Is what I want to tell myself.  
But when everything is about you—  
Oh, by the way, apparently not.  
But that's a truth I'm not ready for.  
I wish I were ready for.
