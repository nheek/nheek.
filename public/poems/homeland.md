# homeland

In twilight's gentle haze, I yearn to return,  
To the homeland that once cradled my dreams,  
Yet fear grips my heart with tendrils of concern,  
What if the present's tapestry unravels at the seams?  

I long for the whispers of familiar winds,  
To dance with memories on streets paved in yore,  
But shadows cast by the unknown future pins  
a worry deep within, a haunting, ghostly lore.  

The soil I tread upon in this foreign land,  
Bears the weight of tales, of joys, and strife,  
Yet a gnawing doubt, like shifting desert sand  
asks, will my journey here vanish like a wisp of life?  

In this dichotomy, I stand on trembling ground,  
Betwixt the past's embrace and future's daunting call,  
Holding on to what I have, a life newly found,  
Yet yearning for the roots, where my essence won’t be small.  

Oh, homeland, your echoes pull at my very core,  
Yet here I’ve built a world, a story finely spun,  
I fear to lose the threads, what I’ve come to adore,  
Balancing on the precipice, betwixt two homes, I’m undone.  

In the twilight's tender glow, I search for a sign,  
A way to reconcile what’s lost and what’s been won,  
Hoping that in the tapestry of time, intertwined,  
Both lands I cherish, their legacies, won’t come undone.
