# The Day the World Will Know

The day the world will know  
There are two sides to one stone.  
The grave submerged with lies of the dead,  
Curses that left the living all scared.

For as light is to dark and quiet is to loud,  
His screams were heard when his head fell off.  
The world is all in doubt; the two sides can't collide,  
Yet he proved them all wrong—he liked it both ways.

His eyes see beauty, his mind forced to choose one.  
Deep in his heart, he knows well:  
The sun and the moon make his heart skip a beat.  
The shadows creep into him; he stepped into the dark.

Black and white he is, but forbidden he feels.  
Spoon and fork it must be—how did the seahorse not see?  
The day the world will know is the day this poem sees light.  
He knows what is to come; he stays in the night.
