# dimlight

You gave the best memories  
Smiling at the back while running to the street.  
You never knew what I did, though.  
The lights were dim before I knew.  

I never noticed some things would change.  
I didn’t hope for everything to tear apart.  

And you never came back.  
Drop the beat, and the flashback starts.  
I see us laughing and dancing with the stars.  
We never knew what would happen next.  
We just let the beat end.  

Going through a lot of stuff,  
Making a movie out of my mind.  
All the things I think of end with a fall,  
And the melody starts with the deepest bass of them all.  

I never knew the wind passed by.  
I didn’t want to call someday, somehow,  

And say we made the best memories.  
We shared the best humor, candies, and cakes.  
We came back with the game in our hands.  
We started our turn and never looked back.  

And tonight, in my room,  
I see our pictures in the album.  
All I see is what they call love,  
And now the lights begin to crack.  

It all started with a smile,  
Deep stares into each other’s eyes.
