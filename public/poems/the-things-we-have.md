# the things we have

The city is asleep, and it is covered in white,  
The bed hugs me like we have never ever met,  
The song feels like home, and the birds stayed dead,  
The rainbow trapped in my room, gifted by a child.

Things I could have kept when I walked the quiet beach,  
Things I wanted to confess to the big blue small earth,  
Things you should have kept from the author of the write,  
Things you must have buried with the fork you can't teach.

We are wearing masks as to not see, or as to see?  
We are juggling memories to shake and forget, or to shake and remember?  
We are as broken as the bright flashing star far up in the sky?  
We are ignoring what we see as to heal, or as to die?

Have you ever seen a tower so high up in the sky?  
Have I ever wondered why the road ended now?  
Have you ever waited for the weekdays to die?  
Have I ever drunk poisoned water and lied?
