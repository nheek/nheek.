# please don't

Relaxing under the sun,
Never knew I was needed by someone.
If only he had told me earlier,
Then we wouldn't worry anymore.

But he didnâ€™t.
He chose to hide it.
He carried the burden
Until he weakened.

Things became obvious.
He finally confessed:
He needs some rest
Above anything else.

I don't want this.
I never did.
He should not be crying.
He must not.

Seeing his tears shed with pain,
I think my life is all in vain.
I wasn't able to stop his tears,
Rushing down with all his fears.

Please don't do it again.
Please don't hide your pain.
I'm here to protect and make sure that
The apple of my eye is in a perfect state.
